# OwnTensorFlow

In this project, I attempt to write my own basic tensorflow. The ultimate goal of this project is to learn more about the math behind Neural Networks, and on more extensible Software Development techniques in C++.

## Notes
- This is a continuation of https://github.com/PredatorFeesh/NeuralNetwork -- that version was a good first attempt.
